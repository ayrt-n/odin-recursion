# Recursion

## Overview

Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) to create two recursive programs.

The first program (fibonacci.rb) takes in a number and outputs an array with fibonacci numbers up until the specified number. The program was developed first with a non-recursive solution and then with a recursive solution.

The second program (merge_sort.rb) is, as the name might imply, a sorting algorithm using merge sort. The program uses a divide and conquer algorithm to sort arrays by splitting the array into two smaller arrays and calling merge sort on those arrays.
